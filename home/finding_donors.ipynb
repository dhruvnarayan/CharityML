    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",

    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "\n",
    "The 3 Supervised Machine Learning models I would select to solve this problem and their reasoning are listed below -\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "a. This linear model can be applied to solve binary classification problems e.g. selection in a university/company based on features like grades, test scores, education level, extra-curricular activities etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. This model performs well when a linear separation is expected for classification. It used Gradient descent and Regularization for optimization and it is a probabilistic model hence derivatives are efficient to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. It does not perform well in case of non-linear boundaries for seperation of classes since it is a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. With this model, we can use Gradient Descent optimization and as discussed in point b. This model has a linear probabilistic error function, it is mathematically efficient to calculate derivatives for the error function and optimize. Since, this problem involves a binary classification for target (income), I believe this model is promising to give a good classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. AdaBoost Esemble Method\n",
    "\n",
    "a. This ensemble method algorithm can be used to solve complex non-linear classification problems e.g. selection of prospective clients for a company based on features like revenue, profits, field of work, other engagements, client reputation etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. It focusses on the weak learner's performance on a particular problem, then develops it's model by including the high performing features of the weak learners to solve more complex problems quickly. Helps reduce Bias in a ML problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. It is succeptible to outliers and does not perform adequetly on high variance problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. This problem for CharityML is a binary classification problem and I believe AdaBoost Ensemble Method algorithm can provide a good classification as the dataset involves a lot of input features (over 100) and different weak learners (Decision Trees) can classify on select set of features. Then AdaBoost can select the best performing features from weak learners and build a model which shall give a good performance on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Gradient Boosting Esemble Method\n",
    "\n",
    "a. This ensemble method algorithm is used for Classification problems using Decision Trees as weak learners. It can be used to classify patient's medical diagnosis (eg. cancer) based on features like age, gender, bmi, resting heart rate, symptoms etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. This ensemble model is good for classification where it is possible to calculate gradient of error function and the strengths of weak learners (Decision Trees) are selected and added at the end. (i.e. once each weak learner has given output).\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Like AdaBoost, this Boosting method is succeptible to outliers. Also, training takes more time since the weak learners are built sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Since this is a binary classification problem with many categorical features and a tabular representation for input features, I believe this model would provide accurate clasification output on target (income). We can optimize the problem with Gradient estimation and it is possible with this dataset.\n"

    "GradientBoostingClassifier is an Ensemble Method Classification algorithm which is a weighted sum of weak learners (Decision Trees). It follows a sequential optimization process. Gradient boosting casts the problem into a gradient descent one: at each iteration we fit a weak learner to the opposite of the gradient of the current fitting error with respect to the current ensemble model. First, we fit the best possible weak learner to pseudo-residuals (approximate the opposite of the gradient with respect to the current strong learner). Then, we compute the value of the optimal step size that defines by how much we update the ensemble model in the direction of the new weak learner. After that, we update the ensemble model by adding the new weak learner multiplied by the step size (make a step of gradient descent). Then, we compute new pseudo-residuals that indicate, for each observation, in which direction we would like to update next the ensemble model predictions. Repeating these steps, we have then build sequentially our L models (L - number of weak learners) and aggregate them following a gradient descent approach.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn.
